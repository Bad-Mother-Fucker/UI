## How To Use

You can [download the latest version here](https://github.com/iOS10-KIT/UI/archive/master.zip). Once downloaded, you're free to use all the Sketch files for UI design work. You're just not allowed to re-package it and claim it as your own— we're all sharing this, plus all designs are [from Apple](http://www.apple.com/ios/ios10-preview/).

Here's what's included in the repo:

- ``UI.sketch`` — This contains most of the new UI elements of iOS 10, such as the new Spotlight Widgets and Status Bars.
- ``Apps`` — This folder contains the templates for the newly-updated apps in iOS 10, namely Maps, Music, Messages, Health and Home.
- ``System`` — This folder contains the new iOS system screens, such as the redesigned lockscreen, Spotlight and Control Centre.

## How You Can Help

We want designers and developers to share these design files, and contribute to this repo as the iOS 10 beta changes over time. **This is the goal of this UI kit**.

If you're familiar with Git, clone the repo and feel free to tweak the files included. If you end up adding new features, screens, UI elements— or change things as the iOS 10 beta improves over time— submit a pull request and we'll merge it back for everyone to share!

If you're not familiar with Git— learn it. Or, share this repo with your friends. The more people know about this, the more people will contribute to this repo! Share it on Twitter, Facebook, or, if you're into taboo, share it on LinkedIn.
