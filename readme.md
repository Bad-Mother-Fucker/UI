## How To Use

You can [download the latest version here](https://github.com/iOS10-KIT/UI/archive/master.zip). Once downloaded, you're free to use all the Sketch files for UI design work. You're just not allowed to re-package it and claim it as your own— we're all sharing this, plus all designs are [from Apple](http://www.apple.com/ios/ios10-preview/).

Here's what's included in the repo:

- ``UI.sketch`` — This contains most of the new UI elements of iOS 10, such as the new Spotlight Widgets and Status Bars.
- ``Apps`` — This folder contains the templates for the newly-updated apps in iOS 10, namely Maps, Music, Messages, Health and Home.
- ``System`` — This folder contains the new iOS system screens, such as the redesigned lockscreen, Spotlight and Control Centre.

You can use the included Sketch files to figure out the overall look and feel of iOS 10, as well as copy the metrics for UI elements. This UI kit is best paired with the [iOS Human Interface Guidelines by Apple](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/).
